		<h2>intro</h2>
		<p>Hi! I'm Whitney and this is my online resume & portfolio. :)</p>
		<p>I'm a 27 year old from North Carolina. I attended Appalachian State University and graduated with a BSBA with a major in computer information systems. I live in Charleston, South Carolina, working as a systems engineer by day, and a code monkey by night.</p>
		<p>Over the years, I've surrounded myself with as much technology as possible, and this website is a result of that influence. My geeky interests lie mostly in Linux and the open source community, information security, web development, and android development.</p>

		<img src="img/hackertracker.png" alt="Hacker Tracker"/>
		<h4>Hacker Tracker</h4>
		<p>The idea is simple. I wanted to make an app for <a href="http://defcon.org" target="_blank">DEF CON</a>. Every year they hand out a booklet with the schedule and events and practically everything you need to know about the conference, so I thought a digital, abbreviated version could be helpful. Abbreviated meaning it would have just the "need to know" information:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Speaker schedules</li>
		<li>Entertainment schedule</li>
		<li>Contest/event information</li>
		<li>Maps of the hotel and the conference</li>
		<li>A live twitter feed of what's going on via #defcon and @_defcon_</li>
		<li>FAQ</li>
		<li>Vendors</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The catch is, most people don't want to connect to the WiFi at the conference, or even use their 3G/4G, so the data would have to be preloaded in a database. With that in mind, I created an sqlite database with the con information.</p>
		<p>The Twitter section is the only part that requires an internet connection, obviously. BUT, it doesn't pull data unless the user is already connected to a network. It also doesn't require the user's twitter credentials since it's just a live feed, and not tied to their account.</p>
		<p>It's a work in progress <s>that I hope to have finished for DEF CON 21</s> that I hope to continue for all future DEF CON's.</p>
		<p>App was written in Java. The database is sqlite. The logo is the official Defcon logo, but all images were created in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.</p>
		<p>The APK can be downloaded <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shortstack.hackertracker" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
		<p>The code can be forked from GitHub <a href="https://GitHub.com/shortstack/HackerTracker" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

		<br/><br/>
		<img src="img/angrybackup.png" alt="Angry Birds Backup"/>
		<h4>Angry Birds Backup</h4>
		<p>I needed a way to transfer my Angry Birds scores between Android devices efficiently, so I wrote an app to do just that. :) Four of them, actually. One for each version of Angry Birds. Except Star Wars because I went and had a baby and didn't have time.</p>
		<p>A user can choose to either save/restore their scores locally between the game and their SD card, or they can create an account and use the online option, which saves/retrieves their score files to/from <a href="http://angrybackup.com" target="_blank">AngryBackup.com</a>.</p>
		<p>I also wrote the web interface that complements the app.</p>
		<p>App was written in Java. Website was written in HTML, CSS, and PHP. The database is MySQL. Images are property of Rovio but were redrawn by me in Adobe Illustrator.</p>
		<p>The apps can be downloaded from Google Play <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Whitney+Champion" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<!--		<br/><br/>
		<img src="img/amazingalex.png" alt="Amazing Alex Backup"/>
		<h4>Amazing Alex Backup</h4>
		<p>After acquiring a solid user base with my Angry Birds Backups, I received an email requesting that I create a backup application for Rovio's Amazing Alex. So here it is.</p>
		<p>A user can choose to either save/restore their scores locally between the game and their SD card, or they can create an account and use the online option, which saves/retrieves their score files to/from the same server as Angry Backup. Users of both applications can use the same account.</p>
		<p>App was written in Java. Scripts querying the database use PHP/SQL. The database is MySQL. Images are property of Rovio but were redrawn by me in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.</p>
		<p>The app can be downloaded from Google Play <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shortstack.amazingalexbackup" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>-->

		<img src="img/feedme.png" alt="Feed Me So'more"/>
		<h4>Feed Me So'more</h4>
		<p>My company held a week-long internal Hackathon at work, so I teamed up with 2 other guys to create this app. It's a baby feeding tracking application that allows you to keep track of your child's feedings, diaper changes, and naps, and share them.</p>
		<p>The app can be downloaded from Google Play <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.feedme" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
		<p>The code can be forked from GitHub <a href="https://GitHub.com/squickone/Feed-Me-Seymore" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

		<br/><br/>
		<img src="img/todozzz.png" alt="To-Do'Zzz"/>
		<h4>To-Do'Zzz</h4>
		<p>My company holds an annual Hackathon open to anyone who wants to compete in teams of 1-3 people. You are given a category and have 12 hours to create an application that somehow fits into that category.</p>
		<p>Disclaimer: I was due to give birth 2 days after I entered this contest. So give me a break.</p>
		<p>The category I was given was sleep/stress, so I created a to-do list application that allows you to time you and your baby's naps, and simultaneously keep track of the tasks you need to get done when you wake up. Since everyone suggests to sleep when your baby sleeps, you might not get to finish everything you wanted to finish before crashing out for a couple hours, and you'll probably forget by the time you wake up. This app allows you and your baby to get some rest without trying to remember all of the things you should be doing besides sleeping that keep you from getting some much-needed shut-eye.</p>
		<p>The app can be downloaded from Google Play <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shortstack" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
